/**
    Base class for all Matcher implementations.
    
    Most implementations can just implement matches: and let matches:describingMismatchTo: call
    it. But if it makes more sense to generate the mismatch description during the matching,
    override matches:describingMismatchTo: and have matches: call it with a nil description.
